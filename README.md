# covfefe
A bash script bringing forth the combined wisdom of notable leaders Donald J. Trump, Vladimir V. Putin, and Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson

Fortune is old & filled with out of date references to Unix systems, IBM mainframes, and forgotten politicians.

The aim of Covfefe is to create a new and updated utilty with references to the modern world - thanks to the three greatest statesmen of recent years. 

The quotes have been carefully selected from a variety of sources and range from the absurd to the disingenous. From the ignorant to the inane. From the hypocritical to hilarious. 

Covfefe is extra fun if you pipe the output to cowsay.
